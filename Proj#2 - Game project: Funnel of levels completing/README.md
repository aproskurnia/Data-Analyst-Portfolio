#### 1. Project Overview:
In this project, I undertook a comprehensive analysis of the "funnel" that guides a new user through the levels upon installing the game. The primary objective was to enhance the First Time User Experience (FTUE), increase conversion rates, fine-tune game balance, optimize the difficulty curve, and refine the monetization strategy encompassing in-app purchases and ads. This endeavor represents a critical step toward creating a more engaging and lucrative gaming environment.

##### Objectives:
- **FTUE Enhancement**: Focused on providing new players with a seamless and enjoyable introduction to the game, encouraging continued engagement from the outset.
- **Conversion Optimization**: Analyzed the user journey to identify potential bottlenecks and optimize the conversion rate at each stage of level completion.
- **Game Balance and Difficulty Curve**: Evaluated the distribution of challenges across levels to ensure a satisfying progression that retains player interest without becoming overly frustrating.
- **Monetization Strategy Refinement**: Delved into in-app purchase and ad performance to strike the right balance between profitability and user satisfaction.

#### 2. Tools and Data Sources:
Tools: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Data Sources: The primary dataset for this analysis is the `plr_smpl_attempts.csv` file, which contains detailed information about all ... .

## **About Me**

Hi, I'm Alina and welcome to my Data Analyst Portfolio!

I am a passionate Analyst with 4 years of experience as a Product Manager in Snapchat, and today I'm seeking an opportunity to be part of the analytics team to aid improve user experience and achieve business goals of the company.

I have extensive experience in finding growth points in products, working in teams and collaborating with cross-functional departments to improve the product through data and design. For the last 4 years in Snapchat, I managed the development of game content for the camera platform, the team consisted of 35+ professionals from different departments. I performed the role of Product Manager, and was responsible for the success of my projects. I cooperated a lot with the analyst and I have extensive experience working with Looker, visualizations and Google Sheets. I worked a lot with AB testing and data analysis of soft and global launches. Our product reached 25M DAU and consisted 300+ mini games, and my most recent achievement was successfully working on improving the game start conversion (from 2-5% to +35%). I managed hypothesis generation and AB testing, collaborated with cross-functional departments to solve problems and improve UI/UX and technical aspects of the product. 
In addition, I worked for 2.5 years in the AR Face Filters team, and was responsible for the development of AR filters from design research and technical aspects of filter assembly to filter launch, AB testing, users analysis of different demographic groups, and pattern finding. Filters developed by me and under my supervision achieved incredible success in metrics (+20% above average) and some of them were hits of the year (+150% above average), and I achieved such success precisely thanks to detailed data analysis and AB testing.

Thanks to my diverse experience in different roles, I can look at products from different angles and combine all my knowledge and observations to conduct quality data analysis and draw parallels between various events, conditions and factors influencing metrics, as well as provide relevant recommendations for improving metrics based on analysis. I also consider attention to detail and a focus on product success to be my strengths.

What I liked most at work was the time when I worked with data, and I realized that in my next position I want to start working specifically as a data analyst, so I devoted the entire last year to training and learning analytics, completed two full courses on product and data analytics and independently practiced data analysis to improve hard skills.

During my last studies, I honed my ability to work with complex data and developed a keen eye for identifying patterns and trends. I also improved my technical skills in SQL, Python, Data Visualization (Tableau, Looker, Amplitude), which I believe will be valuable assets in my role as a data analyst.

My CV in [pdf](CV.pdf).

This repository is to showcase my skills, share projects and track my progress in Data Analytics / Product Analytics related topics.

Feel free to have a look at the work I've done, and I'm more than happy to chat further!

## **Projects**

### **Proj#1** - [Unit Economics in SaaS product](https://github.com/aproskurnia/Data-Analyst-Portfolio/tree/69eee1fab10613abbd88db1eb0884cc6a2f244be/Proj%231%20-%20Unit%20Economics%20%2B%20Product%20metrics%20in%20SaaS)
For this project I extract and analyze data to evaluate key metrics such as MRR, ARPPU, lifetime value (LTV), and churn rate. The project utilizes segmentation techniques and cohort analysis to analyze pricing plans and subscription tiers. Dashboard is created to effectively monitor metrics, communicate findings and support data-driven decision-making. The project aims to improve business strategies, enhance product performance, and drive growth in the SaaS industry.

Tools - Excel, Public Tableau

### **Proj#2** - [Game project: Funnel of levels completing](https://github.com/aproskurnia/Data-Analyst-Portfolio/blob/8bdc8bb97e35f442523191d601eeaf84b86d9abc/Proj%232%20-%20Game%20project%3A%20Funnel%20of%20levels%20completing/README.md)
In this project, I undertook a comprehensive analysis of the "funnel" that guides a new user through the levels upon installing the game. The primary objective was to enhance the First Time User Experience (FTUE), increase conversion rates, fine-tune game balance, and optimize the difficulty curve. This endeavor represents a critical step toward creating a more engaging and lucrative gaming environment.

Tools - Python (Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

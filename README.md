## **About Me**

Hi, I'm Alina and welcome to my Data Analyst Portfolio!

I am a passionate Analyst with over 11 years of experience in IT (game development and social network content products, mainly product management and creative roles), and today I'm seeking an opportunity to be part of the analytics team to aid improve user experience and achieve business goals of the company.

I have extensive expertise in finding growth points in products, working in the team, collaborating with cross-functional departments and leading cross-functional teams to create impact through data and design. Thanks to my diverse experience in different roles, I can look at products from different angles and combine all my knowledge and observations to conduct quality data analysis and draw parallels between various events, conditions and factors influencing metrics, as well as provide relevant recommendations for improving metrics based on analysis. I also consider attention to detail and a focus on product success to be my strengths.

During my last studies, I honed my ability to work with complex data and developed a keen eye for identifying patterns and trends. I also improved my technical skills in SQL, Python, Data Visualization (Tableau, Looker, Amplitude), which I believe will be valuable assets in my role as a data analyst.

In my free time, I enjoy exploring new data analysis tools and techniques, and I am always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. Whether working on a team or independently, I am driven by the thrill of discovering new insights and the satisfaction of using data to solve complex problems.

My CV in [pdf](CV.pdf).

This repository is to showcase my skills, share projects and track my progress in Data Analytics / Product Analytics related topics.

Feel free to have a look at the work I've done, and I'm more than happy to chat further!

## **Projects**

### **Proj#1** - [Unit Economics in SaaS product](https://github.com/aproskurnia/Data-Analyst-Portfolio/tree/69eee1fab10613abbd88db1eb0884cc6a2f244be/Proj%231%20-%20Unit%20Economics%20%2B%20Product%20metrics%20in%20SaaS)
For this project I extract and analyze data to evaluate key metrics such as MRR, ARPPU, lifetime value (LTV), and churn rate. The project utilizes segmentation techniques and cohort analysis to analyze pricing plans and subscription tiers. Dashboard is created to effectively monitor metrics, communicate findings and support data-driven decision-making. The project aims to improve business strategies, enhance product performance, and drive growth in the SaaS industry.

Tools - Excel, Public Tableau

### **Proj#2** - [Game project: Funnel of levels completing](https://github.com/aproskurnia/Data-Analyst-Portfolio/blob/84e21472fc7d3ede8203681e8f48f13b39948988/Proj%232%20-%20Game%20project%3A%20Funnel%20of%20levels%20completing/README.md)
In this project, I undertook a comprehensive analysis of the "funnel" that guides a new user through the levels upon installing the game. The primary objective was to enhance the First Time User Experience (FTUE), increase conversion rates, fine-tune game balance, and optimize the difficulty curve. This endeavor represents a critical step toward creating a more engaging and lucrative gaming environment.

Tools - Python (Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
